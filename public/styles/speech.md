Our goal is to create a digital version of the 7 Wonders board game.

How many of you are familiar with 7 Wonders? [pause briefly]

Thank you. Whether you are familiar or not, by the end of this project, we aim to make you love it even more.

Okay, allow me to introduce it briefly.
7 Wonders is a strategy game where players aim to build their Wonder using various cards that provide resources, shields, and points to grow their civilizations.

Now, as we are all gathered here today, the main focus is to discuss our project's current value.

So far, we have built a working prototype that covers the core gameplay mechanics, including:

Building a structure,

Discarding a card,

Staging a Wonder stage, and

Implementing trading — which adds major strategic depth and excitement.

With that said, let's dive into the presentation and explore our journey so far!
